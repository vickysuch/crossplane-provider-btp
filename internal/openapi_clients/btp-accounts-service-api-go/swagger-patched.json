The global account is the context for billing each customer. \nUse the subaccount APIs to structure your global account according to your organization's and project's requirements regarding members, authorizations, and quotas. This service also provides you with APIs for creating and managing directories. While the use of directories is optional, they allow you to further organize and manage your subaccounts according to your specific technical and business needs. The service also lets you manage the custom properties/tags that you associate with your directories and subaccounts.\nNOTE: These APIs are relevant only for cloud management tools feature set B.

In other words, if the directory has both entitlement and user authorization management enable, you cannot disable just the entitlement management feature without also disabling user authorization management. Likewise, if a directory has only the default features enabled, you cannot enable user authorization management without also enabling entitlement management.\n\nNOTE: Your multi-level account hierarchy can have more than one directory enabled with user authorization and/or entitlement management; however, only one directory in any directory path can have these features enabled. In other words, other directories above or below this directory in the same path can only have the default features specified.
