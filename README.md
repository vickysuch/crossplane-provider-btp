# crossplane-provider-btp-account

## About this project

`crossplane-provider-btp-account` is a [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/) Provider that handles the orchestration of Account related resources on [SAP Business Technology Platform](https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform.html):

- Subaccount
- User Management
- Entitlements
- Service Manager
- Cloud Management
- Environments

Check the documentation for more detailed information on available capabilities for different kinds.


## Requirements and Setup

To install this provider in a kubernetes cluster running crossplane, you can use the provider custom resource, replacing the `<version>`placeholder with the current version of this provider:

```yaml
apiVersion: pkg.crossplane.io/v1
kind: Provider
metadata:
  name: provider-btp-account
spec:
  package: TODO REGISTRY URL/crossplane-provider-btp:<VERSION>
```

You should then see the crossplane controller create a deployment for this provider. Once it becomes healthy, you can connect the provider to you BTP global account following the documentation.

## Developing

For local development, clone this repo and run `make` to initialize the "build" Make submodule we use for running, building and testing first.

Running the provider locally requires kind and docker to be installed on the system.

There are two different make commands for local development:
1. `make dev` creates a kind cluster, installs the CRDs and runs the provider directly.
1. `make dev-debug` only creates a kind cluster and installs the CRDs. You then run/debug the provider with any tool by using the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable set to the kind clusters kubeconfig.

For deleting the cluster again, run `make dev-clean`.

The [Crossplane Provider Development][provider-dev] guide may be of use to add new types to the controller.
